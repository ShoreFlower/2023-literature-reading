  abstract                   = {In this work we address the full state finite-time distributed consensus
   control problem for high-order multi-agent systems (MAS) under directed
   communication topology. Existing protocols for finite time consensus of
   MAS are normally based on the signum function or fractional power state
   feedback, and the finite convergence time is contingent upon the initial
   conditions and other design parameters. In this paper, by using regular
   local state feedback only, we present a distributed and smooth finite
   time control scheme to achieve leader follower consensus under the
   communication topology containing a directed spanning tree. The proposed
   control consists of a finite time observer and a finite time
   compensator. The salient feature of the proposed method is that both the
   finite time intervals for observing leader states and for reaching
   consensus are independent of initial conditions and any other design
   parameters, thus can be explicitly pre-specified, Leader-following
   problem of MAS with both single and multiple leaders are studied. (C)

  abstract                   = {This paper addresses a decentralized leader-follower formation control
   problem for a group of fully actuated unmanned surface vehicles with
   prescribed performance and collision avoidance. The vehicles are subject
   to time-varying external disturbances, and the vehicle dynamics include
   both parametric uncertainties and uncertain nonlinear functions. The
   control objective is to make each vehicle follow its reference
   trajectory and avoid collision between each vehicle and its leader. We
   consider prescribed performance constraints, including transient and
   steady-state performance constraints, on formation tracking errors. In
   the kinematic design, we introduce the dynamic surface control technique
   to avoid the use of vehicle's acceleration. To compensate for the
   uncertainties and disturbances, we apply an adaptive control technique
   to estimate the uncertain parameters including the upper bounds of the
   disturbances and present neural network approximators to estimate
   uncertain nonlinear dynamics. Consequently, we design a decentralized
   adaptive formation controller that ensures uniformly ultimate
   boundedness of the closed-loop system with prescribed performance and
   avoids collision between each vehicle and its leader. Simulation results
   illustrate the effectiveness of the decentralized formation controller.},
